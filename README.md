## THAT DOCKER DUDE

I build stuff, I break stuff, and I also host stuff. Yeah, that’s right I like self‑hosting, and I don’t like my data being handled by greedy corporations. Join me in the Matrix and let’s destroy the lizard kingdom (it’s Mark Zuckerberg, by the way, if you didn’t get it). All of my repositories are hosted on https://git.fossy.my.id
, and GitHub is just a mirror.
